The _Los Angeles Times_ conducted an analysis of agricultural property tax breaks issued by Santa Barbara County for Steve Lopez's Oct. 20, 2018, column ["At Hollister Ranch, homeowners enjoy private beaches — and hefty tax breaks, too."](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-lopez-hollister-taxes-20181020-story.html)

It found that Hollister Ranch owners — including celebrities and wealthy business moguls — had their property tax trimmed by roughly 50% this year, reducing the county's revenue by about $2 million.
